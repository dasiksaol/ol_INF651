      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Typingtest is a small typing practice tool inspired by modern
        typing websites. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
        demonstrates JavaScript concepts such as events, DOM manipulation,
        timing, state management, and localStorage.

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a time limit, mode (words or sentences), and theme.</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Start</strong> and begin typing when the text appears.</li>
        <li>
          The app tracks your raw WPM, adjusted WPM based on errors, and
          accuracy in real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the test, results are shown and your best stats are
          stored locally in your browser which can be accessed in "stats" page
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          What is WPM?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            WPM stands for words per minute. Raw WPM is calculated from all characters you type.
            Adjusted WPM subtracts the impact of errors.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          How is accuracy calculated?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Accuracy is the percentage of correctly typed characters out of all
            characters typed. For example, if you type 100 characters and 90 of
            them are correct, your accuracy is 90%.

        <button class="faq-question">
          Where are my stats stored?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Your best WPM, best accuracy, and the total number of tests
            completed are stored using <code>localStorage</code> in your
            browser. You can find them in "Stats" page
          </p>

          <p>
            The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates
            event listeners, DOM updates, timing with <code>setInterval</code>,
            arrays and objects for data, conditional logic, and browser storage.
